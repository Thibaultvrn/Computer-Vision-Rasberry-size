# üçì Computer Vision for Raspberry Ripeness & Size Detection
## ME-320 ‚Äì Product & Engineering Design (EPFL)

### üéØ Project Overview
This project is part of the **ME-320 Product and Engineering Design** course at EPFL.  
Our objective is to develop a **robotic gripper** capable of harvesting **soft fruits (raspberries, strawberries, blackberries)** without damaging them.

As part of this project, this program focuses on the **Computer Vision module**, whose goal is to:
- Detect whether a raspberry is **ripe or unripe** based on its **color**.
- Estimate the **size (diameter)** of the fruit in millimeters.
- Communicate this information to the gripper control system (Arduino) for decision-making.

### üß† Context
Harvesting soft fruits is a delicate process: too much force damages the fruit, and unripe fruits must be left on the plant.  
Our Computer Vision system assists the robotic gripper by:
1. Identifying **ripe fruits** (red or dark color, higher sugar content).  
2. Measuring their **approximate size** (between **10 mm and 30 mm** diameter, as specified in the course requirements).  
3. Sending the detection signal to the **Arduino control unit** via serial communication.

### üß© System Architecture
The system is divided into two main parts:

| Component | Role | Language |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **Arduino (C++)** | Controls actuators and sensors of the gripper | C / C++ |
| **Computer Vision (Python)** | Detects fruit ripeness and size using OpenCV | Python 3 |

Data is exchanged through the **serial interface** (`PySerial`).

### üß™ Detection Principles

1. **Color Analysis**  
   - Convert image to **HSV color space**.  
   - Define color ranges for:
     - Ripe: deep red / dark tones
     - Unripe: light red / white  
   - Apply masks and count red pixels.

2. **Size Estimation**  
   - Detect contours in the image.  
   - Approximate the diameter of the detected fruit region in pixels.  
   - Convert pixels ‚Üí millimeters using a reference object or camera calibration.  
   - Expected diameter range: **10 mm ‚â§ D ‚â§ 30 mm**.

3. **Decision Logic**  
   - If ripe and within valid size range ‚Üí signal `RIPE` (Arduino receives command to grip).  
   - Else ‚Üí `UNRIPE` (Arduino does nothing).
